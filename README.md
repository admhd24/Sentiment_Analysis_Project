# Sentiment Analysis Model

Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows us to determine algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”.

Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals, organizations and governments to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods of war and political instability, such as year 2022, when russia started the unprovoked war in Ukraine. Politicians, media and organizations can benefit from sentiment analysis by making appropriate changes to their campaigning, news coverage, and strategies respectively.

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information – in our case, social media posts/tweets and news articles posted recently on the war of Ukraine against russia - and answer the research question: “What can public opinion tell us about the russia’s war against Ukraine in 2022-2023?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and other social media and news platforms to get insights into the war.
